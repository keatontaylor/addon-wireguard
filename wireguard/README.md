![WireGuard screenshot][screenshot]

WireGuard VPN for Home Assistant

## About

WireGuardÂ® is an extremely simple yet fast and modern VPN that utilizes 
state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and 
more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to 
be considerably more performant than OpenVPN. WireGuard is designed as a 
general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers 
alike, fit for many different circumstances.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Hass.io add-on.

1. [Add our Hass.io add-ons repository][repository] to your Hass.io instance.
1. Install the "WireGuard" add-on.
1. Start the "WireGuard" add-on
1. Check the logs of the "WireGuard" add-on to see if everything went well.

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```json
{
  "log_level": "info",
  "gateway": false,
  "port": 51820,
  "ip_address": "192.168.99.1/24",
  "private_key": "gIvaysivTg6FCHbhgOLpOWWNbufb++KwwEn2wm0ug18=",
  "peers": [
    {
      "public_key": "ygVW11hV6nFY0LSRlj6w2m2U0NslQVB+swVFWPwD6Q8=",
      "preshared_key": "XdpKgrzDqhcOqvGUNRpWGMV/9EwY+xvxYT++Z1t289I=",
      "endpoint": "example.com:51820",
      "allowed_ips": [
        "192.168.99.2/32"
      ],
      "keepalive": 25
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and past it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

These log level also affects the log levels of the AppDaemon.

### Option: `gateway`

Allows you to specify if the WireGuard connection will be used as a gateway to
all networks attached to Hass.io instance. `false` will limit access to Hass.io
only.

### Option: `port`

Allows you to specify the UDP port used for the WireGuard connection.

**Note**: _If you anticipate using WireGuard from outside of you network, be
sure to add port forwarding rules to your router._

### Option: `ip_address`

Allows you to specify the IP address used for the WireGuard connection. This
must be in the form of CIDR notation.

**Note**: _This address and network needs to be unique to the Hass.io instance
and all peers that are configured. For example, if your home network is
192.168.1.0/24, you cannot use any IP in that network range for this option._

### Option: `private_key`

Allows you to specify the private key used for the WireGuard connection. If
this option is empty, the private key will be automatically generated.

**Note**: _Private key will be printed to the log. The public key needed by the
peers will be printed to printed to the log._

### Option: `peers`

Allows you to specify the peers used for the WireGuard connection. This is a
list of peer connections.

### Option: `public_key`

Allows you to specify the public key used for the peer connection. This is
generated from the peer device.

### Option: `preshared_key`

Allows you to specify the preshared key used for the peer connection. This is
can be an empty string.

### Option: `endpoint`

Allows you to specify the IP/FQDN address and port used for the peer
connection. This is can be an empty string.

**Note**: _This has to be in the form of '<IP/FQDN>:<PORT>'._

### Option: `allowed_ips`

Allows you to specify the list of IPs used for the peer connection. This must
be in the form of CIDR notation.

**Note**: _For network connectivity integrity, this should be limited to the
WireGuard interface address of the peer._

### Option: `keepalive`

Allows you to specify the keepalive threshold used for the peer connection.
This should be an integer value.

**Note**: _UDP ports are normally closed after 30 seconds. For a reliable
connection to the peer, set this value below 30._
